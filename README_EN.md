## 🛡️ Security Scanning Details

### Scanning Mechanism

Our security scanning engine analyzes every file of skill code to detect potential risks:

- **File scanning strategy**: Skip large directories like `node_modules`, `target`, limit scan depth and file count
- **Symbolic link detection**: Immediately hard-block on symlink discovery, prevent attacks
- **Multi-format support**: Support `.js`, `.ts`, `.py`, `.sh`, `.rs` and other code formats

### Risk Classification

| Category                  | Detection Content           | Examples                          |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| **Destructive Operations** | Delete system files, disk wipe | `rm -rf /`, `mkfs`           |
| **Remote Code Execution**  | Pipe execution, deserialization | `curl \| bash`, `pickle.loads` |
| **Command Injection**      | Dynamic command concatenation | `eval()`, `os.system()`       |
| **Data Exfiltration**      | Data exfiltration to remote servers | `curl -d @file`             |
| **Privilege Escalation**   | Escalation operations       | `sudo`, `chmod 777`           |
| **Persistence**            | Backdoor implantation       | `crontab`, SSH key injection    |
| **Sensitive Info Leakage** | Hardcoded keys, Tokens      | AWS Key, GitHub Token           |
| **Sensitive File Access**  | Access system sensitive files | `~/.ssh/`, `/etc/passwd`    |

### Scoring System

- **90-100 (✅ Safe)**: Safe to use
- **70-89 (⚠️ Low Risk)**: Minor risk, recommend checking details
- **50-69 (⚠️ Medium Risk)**: Certain risk, use with caution
- **30-49 (🔴 High Risk)**: High risk, not recommended for installation
- **0-29 (🚨 Critical Risk)**: Serious threat, installation prohibited

### Disclaimer

Security scanning is based on preset rules, designed to help identify potential risks, but cannot guarantee 100% accuracy, and false positives or false negatives may exist. It is recommended to carefully read the skill source code before installation and be extra cautious with skills from untrusted sources. Users assume all consequences of using this program.
